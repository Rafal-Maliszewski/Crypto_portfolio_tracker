Welcome to my Crypto Tracker program designed to help you track a cryptocurrencies wallet.

HOW IT WORKS
The mechanic of this program is to check the coin prices, then generate a text file with the values of your coins and make a wheel chart of it. 

HOW TO USE
Remeber to fullfill the configuration file "currencies.txt" with your coin portfolio. Always write a coin ticker with "USDT" included (example: "BTCUSDT") as the program is not designed to translate to other than the USDT prices. Then simply run the python code. 
 
TECHNICAL ISSUES
Note that if you have many different coins, website servers can respond longer and execution time will vary from few second to few minutes. It is normal for program to slow down at the end.

If you notice any other issues feel free to contact.
